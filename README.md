# US-Patent-Scraping
Python Code to Scrape Patents Data from USPTO
The python code 'Selenium_patent_Search_4_3B' included in this folder was written by me for a research project at UC Berkeley to scrape patent data from the USPTO website: assignment.uspto.gov

The code takes in a csv file containing a list of firms and outputs the number of patents filed for each firm during a time perod.
